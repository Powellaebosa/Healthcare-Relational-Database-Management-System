# Healthcare-Relational-Database-Management-System
In this project I demonstrated the design and implementation of a relational database system tailored for a healthcare environment. The system models essential entities such as Patients, Doctors, Nurses, Admin staff, and Researchers, and focuses on how these roles interact to manage appointments, patient records, and research operations efficiently.
